# DnD-Character-sheet
This is a simple app that allows users to create a character for the Dungeons and Dragons Essentials version of the classic tabletop RPG.
Characters are saved in an XML file on the device. New characters will be created in two ways: an automated process for quick characters
without much input, and a "blank slate" that lets the user type in their own values for the character.

What this App will not do is replace the need for the user to own a copy of the official rule books. The developer of this application supports the game's creators. As such, any spells, feats, list of class skill, equipment, etc. will be required by the user to be written manually.
